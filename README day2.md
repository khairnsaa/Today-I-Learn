# Today-I-Learn

Today i learn in LearningX - Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp

today is the second day of bootcamp programme. our agenda is starting to make our project. so far my team finish create the design and turn that design into HTML code. and trying to create "read" and "add" function. but sadly we've got a problem with our database. still don't know what the problem is, but hoping can solve this problem faster

it's been a fun journey for me joining this bootcamp. my goal is i hope i can get more new friends, new connection, and ofcourse new skills
