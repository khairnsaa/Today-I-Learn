we still doesn't have a name for our project, so we just name it "social media app".
there are a few features that we made these past 3 days, there are add post, edit post, delete post, login, and search

for the login, we've created a dummy data for people to login, and after you login, you can create a post.
NOTE: you **CAN'T** create a post without login
