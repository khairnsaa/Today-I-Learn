## Promise (Javascript)

1. A promise represents a process that guaranteed to complete the execution
2. Promises have 3 states, these states are **pending, resolved,** and **rejected.**
3. If the promise is chained with **.then(),** that continues the execution after adding the function to the callback chain.
4. Error handling can be done with **.then()** and **.catch()** methods.
5. Promise chaining can be difficult to understand and follow
6. Promises can be used for multiple promises in the promise chaining.

## Async - Await

1. Async await is syntactic sugar for promises. Making code looks like executed synchronously.
2. Error handling can be done with a try-catch block.
3. Async/Await makes reading the promises flow much easier. Understanding the functionality is also very easy compared to promises.

## Should you use Promise or Async - Await?

1. Using async/await definitely will help you to understand asynchronous processes much faster.
2. Instead of using promise chaining async / await provides a much cleaner code.
3. Async await makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code.

## Conclusion
Using async/await definitely will provide you with many benefits while you are working on big projects and it makes your and other developer's life easy.
