## SPA VS MPA
The difference between SPA and MPA is that MPAs secure each page to its core. it takes more timee and effort to maintain the security, hence, it will take more time to loading the page.

SPAs secure endpoints faster, but the security level is low. SPAs generally rely in javascripts. This makes them vulnerable to being attacked by cybercriminals because of the data not being compiled for security. SPAs are considered more “modern” and attuned to today’s agile development needs.

However, this doesn’t mean that MPAs don’t work out. Amazon is an MPA and this effectively means that whenever you request new content, the page has to reload all over again. this is considered conventional architecture, but i’ts still highly valuable and is used with great results.

MPAs are best suited for complex websites that do not require a continuation of approach. For e.g. on amazon you don’t require uour page to stay the same when you want to view a product or category. so if you are thinkong of building let’s say a very large ecommerce site, then you sould opt for an MPA architecture.
