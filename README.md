# Today-I-Learn

Today i learn in LearningX - Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp

today i finished this week personal task. creating todo list with redux. it's not my first time using redux, i've used redux before, but usually i used redux with redux toolkit. and in this project i can't use redux toolkit. it's a bit confusing for me, because there's a few different things when you're using the toolkit or not. i know my code is bit cutlery, still improving with DRY principle. by the way if you want to see my todo list project you can see it [here](https://todo-list-redux-phi.vercel.app)

the website view is little bit ugly, because i used styled-component. it's hard for me to use styled-component because you're writing css in js file, there's no snippet in there... to sum it up... it's hard using styled-component for me. but i try my best

this is the view of my project
