Today i learn in LearningX - Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp

today is the first day of week 7. this week we're gonna learn about node js mastery. we're gonna make a rest API again, but the different is in this week we also will create the api for sign up and sign in with JWT.

today also we watch the video lecture. but due to the internet problem my team cannot watch it together. instead we watched it alone. after watching  video lecture. we need to submit 2 question to play kahoot. our team question is

## Q1 Which object in Javascript that doesn’t have a prototype?
a. Base object
b. All of object have prototype
c. None of object in JavaScript
d. None of the above

answer: A
All objects have prototypes, except for the base object. The base object is Object.prototype, it is a property of the Object constructor and it is also the end of a prototype chain.

## Q2 How to handle error in JavaScript?
A. Try / error
B. Try / catch
C. Try / throw
D. Try / finally

Answer: B
When trying to change the names in users to uppercase using String.toUpperCase(), an error occurs if data other than a string is entered.

To deal with this unexpected error, you can wrap the entire code in a try … catch statement.

Even if an error occurs, the program can log the error without stopping.

after that we played kahoot, but sadly our team not winning. at least we're in runner up place
