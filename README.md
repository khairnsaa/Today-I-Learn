## Redux Ecosystem
Redux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions, and the community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and tools. You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but they can help make it easier to implement features and solve problems in your application.
