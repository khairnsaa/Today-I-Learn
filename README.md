Today i learn in LearningX - Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp

this week team task is cloning an application. my team planned to clone twitter, we won't create all of the feature that twitter has because some of their features is hard to implement in short amount of time. so some feature we implement in this project is, adding new tweet, delete tweet, reply other people tweet, like the tweet and (maybe) add a retweet feature too (if there's still time to implement it). note that all of the tweet that created in our clone app is public tweet, so, even though you not following people, but their tweet will appear on you timeline. also, we won't create a follow feature in this clone app, because we think it's a bit hard. But, if we have some plenty time to improve our app, we might add that feature

this is the user interface for our twitter clone project!
