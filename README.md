# Today-I-Learn Day 4

Today i learn in LearningX - Sparta Coding Club Bootcamp | fullstack developer

today is the last day of the first week in this bootcamp. i've learn few many things like debugging in python. so in my friends laptop there's a problem when adding a budget list, the budget will be added twice, and all of us didn't know what the problem is. and then our mentor show up and help us to find where the problem is. the problem is the function to adding the budget to the list is called twice, so it'll be added twice too

so far this bootcamp feels fun. i don't know what my teammates opinion about this. but i think me and my teammate is getting closer with working project together. and it feels nice to make new friend
