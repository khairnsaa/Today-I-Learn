 ## What is a Package Manager?
 A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer, and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer versions, or remove software that you previously installed. As the name suggests, package managers deal with packages: collections of files that are bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group.
 
 A JavaScript package manager most notably used in conjunction with Node.js, although it can be used independently as well. It gives you exceptional control over your projectâ€™s dependencies and provides a great way to contribute to the open-source world. 
 
 You can get started by simply running `npm install <package name>` and injecting it into your JavaScript file.
 
 If you want to install for the specific version you can run this command `npm install <package name>@1.2.3.`
 
 ## Why do we need `package.json?`
 Your project's package.json is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run your application. It is used by the npm CLI (and yarn) to identify your project and understand how to handle the project's dependencies. It's the package.json file that enables npm to start your project, run scripts, install dependencies, publish to the NPM registry, and many other useful tasks. The npm CLI is also the best way to manage your package.json because it helps generate and update your package.json file throughout a project's life.
